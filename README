* Guile-CV

Guile-CV [1]
a Computer Vision functional programming library for Guile [2]

** Description

Guile-CV is a Computer Vision functional programming library for the
Guile Scheme language.  Guile-CV is based on Vigra (Vision with Generic
Algorithms) [3].  It comprises a direct binding to Vigra_c [4] (a C
wrapper to some of the Vigra functionality), and a higher level API
written in Guile Scheme [5].

** What else

Guile-CV is almost entirely written in Guile Scheme, though for
performance reasons, some basic operations are implemented in C (see
libguile-cv if you are interested).  This C code is kept to the very
strict minimum and _not_ part of the API: as Guile Scheme evolves,
targeting an AOT compiler, we may rewrite these in scheme at any moment.

** Savannah

Guile-CV also has a Savannah [6] project page.
