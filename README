GNU Guile-CV [1]
a Computer Vision functional programming library for Guile [2]

** Description

Guile-CV is a Computer Vision functional programming library for the
Guile Scheme language.  Guile-CV is based on Vigra (Vision with Generic
Algorithms) [3].  It comprises a direct binding to Vigra_c [4] (a C
wrapper to some of the Vigra functionality), and a higher level API
written in Guile Scheme [5].

** What else

Guile-CV is entirely written in Guile, no C code.
