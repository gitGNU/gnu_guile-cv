** Februrary the 18th, 2017

Guile-CV version 0.1.1 is released, the next maintenance release for
the 0.1 series.

	Special note:
	-------------

	(a) that this release is not made 'public' yet, because it is
	still under evaluation to see whether it will be part of GNU or
	not: if yes, fine; if not, I would need to change all
	occurrences of 'Guile-CV' to 'Guile-CV' and all copyright
	notices from 'Free Software Foundation, Inc.' to myself;

	(b) see INSTALL for tarball location during the evaluation
	period.

*** Changes since 0.1.0

Incompatible API change:
------------------------

	Fixing im-flip to refer to a plane rather then an axis: Vigra
    flips (their terminology is reflect, not flip) images and channels
    with respect to an axis, not by reference to a plane. In our
    opinion, this is [unnecessarily] confusing, so we decided to go
    ahead and fix this in Guile-CV.  See the manual (and commit ff62dfa
    for further details and if you are interested to read the source
    code modifications).

New functionality:
------------------

	im-load, im-save: support for RGBA images has been added

	support for image transposition and normalization

New procedures:
---------------

	im-rgba->rgb, im-rgba->grey

	im-transpose, im-transpose-channel, im-normalize,
	im-normalize-channel

	im-add, im-add-channel, im-substract, im-substract-channel,
	im-multiply, im-multiply-channel, im-divide, im-divide-channel

** Special note

The text below as well as 'Older News' are kept as a 'prototype' that we
will use once the project effectively becomes part of GNU, if it does of
course...
