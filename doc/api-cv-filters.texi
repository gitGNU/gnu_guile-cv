@deffn Procedure im-gaussian-blur image sigma
@deffnx Procedure im-gaussian-blur-channel channel width height sigma
@cindex Gaussian blur
@cindex Gaussian smooth

Returns a new image or channel.

The new image or new channel is the result of the computation of the
Gaussian blurring, also known as the Gaussian smoothing, by means of a
convolution of @var{image} or @var{channel} with a 2D Gaussian function,
where @var{sigma} is the standard deviation of the Gaussian
distribution.

@var{sigma}.

The new image or new channel is the result of the computation of the
strength of the first order partial derivatives by means of a
convolution of @var{image} or @var{channel} with the first order
derivative of a 2D Gaussian function, where @var{sigma} is the standard
deviation of the Gaussian distribution.
