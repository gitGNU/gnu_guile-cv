Guile-CV Reference Manual still is a mock-up: any help is more then
welcome to improve this situation, thanks!


@subheading Images used Guile-CV's documentation

All images used in Guile-CV's documentation are distributed with the
source and installed here:

@example
$prefix/share/doc/guile-cv/images
@end example

All examples using @code{im-load} and @code{im-save} given in this
manual, unless a full pathname is specified, assume that the guile
current working directory is the above mentioned directory.  Assuming
you did install in @file{/opt}, just as an example of course, a typical
Guile-CV (example) session inialization steps would be:

@lisp
M-x run-guile
...
@print{}
scheme@@(guile-user)> (chdir "/opt/share/doc/guile-cv/images")
scheme@@(guile-user)> ,use (cv)
scheme@@(guile-user)> (im-load "lenna.png")
$2 = (512 512 3 (#f32(226.0 226.0 223.0 223.0 227.0 …) …))
@end lisp

Note that to benefit from Emacs's Tab completion mechanism, while typing
image filenames, Emacs itself must be in that directory, which you
acheive like this (still assuming, as an example, that you did install
in @file{/opt}):

@example
M-x cd
@print{}
Change default directory: /opt/share/doc/guile-cv/images
@end example
